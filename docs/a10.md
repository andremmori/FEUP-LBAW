# A10: Presentation

The purpose of this project was to develop a web application for an event management platform.

The goal of this artefact is to promote, present and demonstrate the product developed.

## 1. Product presentation

Meethology is an event management web application for people who want to create events or participate in others.
The user is able to search for events using the website filters, invite other people through email, purchase tickets and create their own events.

Each event page has a description with all the information needed, it's own comment section, list of participants and photos of the event.
The administrator is able to promote other users to admin position, ban users and remove commentaries and events by evaluating the reports.
