# A3: User Interface Prototype

**Meethology** is an event managing platform that users can create and join events based on their interests.

This artefact includes an overview of the user interface and features common to all pages, an overview about the *Sitemap* and a description of the main interactions with the web application. Each interface is described at the end of the artefact.

## 1. Interface and common features

**Meethology** is based on HTML5, PHP, CSS and JavaScript. Bootstrap framework was used to simplify the implementation of the User Interface.
