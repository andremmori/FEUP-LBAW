# A9: Product


The product developed is an event managing platform that users can create and join events based on their interests. The platform gives any registered user the ability to host his own event, as well as join other people's events.


## 1. Installation


The source code can be found [here](../src/).

The final release can be found at: http://lbaw2066.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt.

Docker Command to test:

```sh
docker-compose up

docker exec lbaw_php php artisan db:seed 

docker run -it -p 8000:80 -e DB_DATABASE=lbaw2066 -e DB_USERNAME=lbaw2066 -e DB_PASSWORD=* lbaw2066/lbaw2066
```


## 2. Usage

The product can be found at: http://lbaw2066.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt  

### 2.1. Administration Credentials


| Username             | Password |
| -------------------- | -------- |
| admin@meethology.com | admin    |

### 2.2. User Credentials

| Type               | Username              | Password |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | -------- |
| authenticated user | test@meethology.com   | password |

## 3. Application Help

Help has been implemented in forms, giving the user a real time feedback about the inputs he typed, if they were wrong, and displaying a message on what was supposed to be submitted.

There is also a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page where the user can see a couple of questions that would help him use the app.

## 4. Input Validation

Input data validation was used in the forms, adding the _pattern_ attribute which displays an error message in case the input was not according to what was expected (regex). For example: when a user is creating an account he can't use numbers in his name. In the server side, there is a verification if the input received is correct by using validators or checking if it is null.

## 5. Check Accessibility and Usability

 Accessibility as can be seen in [here](lbaw2066_a9-accessibility.pdf): 16/18 according to https://ux.sapo.pt/checklists/acessibilidade/.


 Usability as can be seen in [here](lbaw2066_a9-usability.pdf): 19/28 according to https://ux.sapo.pt/checklists/usabilidade/.



## 6. HTML & CSS Validation

The HTML validation provided a couple of errors, as can be seen in [HTML](lbaw2066_a9-html.pdf).

The CSS validation provided no errors, as can be seen in [CSS](lbaw2066_a9-css.pdf).

## 7. Revisions to the Project

During the development of the project there were new user stories implemented, such as:

* Demote User
* See Participants
  
There also was a change in the original tables, such as adding the parameter _promoted_ in the __Promotion__ table. To be able to complete the __Ban User__ User Story it was also necessary to add a _banned_ attribute to the __User__ table.

Another change was the priorities of some User Stories, making non trivial stories which involved other APIs lower priority.

## 8. Implementation Details

### 8.1. Libraries Used

The following libraries were used:

* Bootstrap
* paypal/PayPal-PHP-SDK

### 8.2 User Stories

Observations:

User Story __[US1.10] Payment using External API__ is fully functional in Localhost, but due to some package errors it is not functional in the Remote Image, this is why it is set to 50% complete.
